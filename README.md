![Hackatime Badge](https://hackatime-badge.hackclub.com/U07V1ND4H0Q/pbhak.dev)

my personal website!

nothing too fancy, but i think it's pretty neat:
- the theme switcher in the top right is automatically populated with data from `src/color_schemes.json`
- last listened to song queries the [last.fm](https://last.fm) API for data 
- recent repositories update on page load via GitHub API
- slack status dynamically updates on page load by querying my [slack bot](https://github.com/pbhak/utilities)
